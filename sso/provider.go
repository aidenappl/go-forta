// Package sso implements the relying-party half of an OAuth2/OpenID Connect
// single sign-on flow, as a library with no opinion about what a user is.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// Three services on this platform each grew their own copy of an SSO flow, and
// the copies drifted in ways that matter. One generated a PKCE verifier and then
// silently dropped it at the token exchange, which is PKCE that looks
// implemented and defends nothing. One keyed identity on EMAIL rather than on
// (provider, subject), which is an account-takeover primitive the moment an IdP
// lets an address be reassigned. One never checked the `nonce` — go-oidc's
// Verify() deliberately does not check it, so "we use a library" is not
// sufficient. One had no bound on how long it would trust a stale introspection
// result.
//
// Each of those is a subtle, silent defect that a working login does not reveal.
// The fix is not three more code reviews; it is one implementation where the
// defended path is the only path.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHAT THIS PACKAGE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT KNOW
//
// It does not know what a user is, where sessions live, how secrets are stored,
// or what your schema looks like. Three interfaces are the whole contract:
//
//	UserResolver  — identity → your user. You own provisioning and linking.
//	StateStore    — where an in-flight login's state lives, single-use.
//	SessionStore  — where a live SSO session's cached tokens live.
//
// Everything else is a plain struct you fill in. In particular Provider is NOT
// a database row: each application maps its own table (or its config file, or a
// literal) onto it. That is what lets a service with no provider table use this
// at all.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE INVARIANTS. Do not make these configurable.
//
//  1. Identity is (Provider, Subject). NEVER email. Email is a hint used only
//     for the strictly-gated verified-both-sides link.
//  2. PKCE S256 is always generated and always sent.
//  3. `nonce` is always verified on an id_token.
//  4. `state` is single-use, server-side, and never derived from a cookie.
//  5. A UserInfo response whose `sub` differs from the id_token's `sub` is
//     discarded, not merged (OIDC Core §5.3.2).
//
// A caller cannot switch any of these off, because every one of them was found
// missing in a shipped implementation that appeared to work.

//
// ClientSecret is the RESOLVED secret, not a reference to one. Resolving it is
